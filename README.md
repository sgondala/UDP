Bugs: <br>
1) After selecting server, If we come to client, its not working. Probably because of infi loop, Should check. <br>

TODO: <br>
1)Client side - Client talks continuously, So capture it, divide into packets and send one by one <br>
2)Server side - Capture the packets, store them in a queue and play them one by one <br>

Doubts: <br>
1) Check if AsyncTask thread stops after the work is done.
2) Check if ExternalStorage is available
